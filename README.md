Projects for Advanced Programming Principles:

Project 1:

  Description: Implements a functional representation of polynomials using OCaml's algebraicdata types and pattern matching.
  Polynomials are modeled as recursive lists of terms, each containing an integer and coefficient. This project includes tools
  for constructing and performing arithmetic on polynomials.

  Run and Compile: Run and compile printPoly.ml

Project 2:

  Description: Implements components for parsing lisp expressions. It includes a custom data type "thing" for lisp values, a
  lexical scanner that reads lisp expressions from a file, tokenizes them, and handles commments, and a parser module that 
  conversts tokens into a "thing".

  Run and Compile: Run and compile testsP2.ml
