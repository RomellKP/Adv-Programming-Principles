# Projects for Advanced Programming Principles:

## Project 1:

  ### Description: 
  Implements a functional representation of polynomials using OCaml's algebraicdata types and pattern matching.
  Polynomials are modeled as recursive lists of terms, each containing an integer and coefficient. This project includes tools
  for constructing and performing arithmetic on polynomials.

  ### How to Run: 
  1. Run and compile printPoly.ml

  ### My Contributions: 
  - project1.ml

## Project 2:

  ### Description: 
  Implements components for parsing lisp expressions. It includes a custom data type "thing" for lisp values, a
  lexical scanner that reads lisp expressions from a file, tokenizes them, and handles commments, and a parser module that 
  conversts tokens into a "thing".

  ### How to Run: 
  1. Run and compile testsP2.ml

  ### My Contributions: 
  - parser.ml

## Project 3:

  ### Description: 
  This project is a list interpreter that supports arithmetic operations, list processing, closures, and user-defined
  functions. The scanner converts code strings into a list of tokens, symbols and numbers. The parser translates tokens into an 
  abstract syntax tree. The evaluator recursively evaluates expressions. The printer converts internal data structures into readable
  lisp syntax
