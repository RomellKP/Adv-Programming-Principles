Projects for Advanced Programming Principles:

Project 1:

  Description: Implements a functional representation of polynomials using OCaml's algebraicdata types and pattern matching.
  Polynomials are modeled as recursive lists of terms, each containing an integer and coefficient. This project includes tools
  for constructing and performing arithmetic on polynomials.
